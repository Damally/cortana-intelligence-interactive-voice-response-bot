# Interactive Voice Response on Azure - A Cortana Intelligence Solution

Call centers are essential to businesses of any size. In fact, 61% of consumers prefer to communicate over the phone, and most of them [prefer self-service][3]. Given that customer satisfaction is a priority for all businesses, it is clear that self-service is no longer optional. 

This solution is an intelligent, bot-driven, automation app ideal for fulfilling specific consumer needs. Businesses with no existing IVR can easily get started on building and improving customer relations, while companies with manned call centers or old IVR systems can utilize this solution to improve customer satisfaction while optimizing costs and productivity.

Today, mobile phones are dominant, but keypads are not always readily accessible. This solution provides an intuitive, simple, and convenient way for callers to convey their requests and receive immediate responses. The outcome is an intelligent and natural self-service experience that can be repurposed across other customer-facing channels.

This solution package contains materials to help both technical and business audiences understand the solution, which is built on [Azure][7] and [Microsoft Cognitive Services][2].
