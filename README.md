# Call Center Automation - A Cortana Intelligence Solution

Call centers are essential to businesses of any size. In fact, 61% of consumers prefer to communicate over the phone, and most of them prefer self-service. Given that customer satisfaction is a priority for all businesses, it is clear that self-service is no longer optional. 

Call Center Automation (CCA) is an intelligent multi-language call center solution, and is ideal for fulfilling these consumer needs. Businesses with no existing call center solution can easily get started on building and improving customer relations, while companies with manned call centers or old Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems can utilize CCA to improve customer satisfaction while optimizing costs and productivity.

In an era where mobile phones are dominant and keypads are not always readily accessible, Call Center Automation provides an intuitive, simple, and convenient way for callers to convey their requests. CCA provides an intelligent and natural self-service experience that can be repurposed across other customer channels.

This solution package contains materials to help both technical and business audiences understand our call center solution built on the [Cortana Intelligence Suite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/cortana-intelligence-suite/Overview.aspx) and Microsoft Cognitive Services.
